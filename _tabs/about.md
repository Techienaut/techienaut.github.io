> **Summary**: Software Developer with a whimsical sense-of-humor and an overly obsessive fascination with Japan.

Hi, welcome to my blog. I go by either Anthony or, preferably, Techienaut (or "Techie" for short). I love software, especially when it runs smooth like butter ðŸ¤¤. Software development is a learning/cultural/creative experience everyone should attempt at least once. And I hope that this blog will be of some inspiration to devs entering the work field, or those who just want to do their own personal projects. (I will be doing discord bot tutorials in the future.)

My background is in IT and Software Development. I've worked about 2 years in colleges and business offices as an IT Technician. My experience in Development includes a 10-week coding bootcamp at General Assembly and dabbling with tech since 2012--which is when I started attending the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign's Computer Science program.

My interests and hobbies include socializing on Discord, Rocket League, watching Twitch streams, and gawking at new apps on Product Hunt.

I hope to start my own open-source coding bootcamp for those who want to avoid the $20k bill that comes with most bootcamps, which--let's be honest--they could have done with a $200 laptop, and watching YouTube tutorials at their local public library's WiFi. (Kind of a new-age version of that quote from **Goodwill Hunting**...how bout dem apples?)

If you have any questions for me, I'm usually available on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Techienaut). Otherwise, contact me using the socials on the left navigation bar. Thanks and remember...HACK THE PLANET! ðŸŒ³
