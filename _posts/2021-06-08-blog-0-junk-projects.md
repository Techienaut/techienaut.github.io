# Bonjour!

Hey everyone, [@techienaut](https://twitter.com/techienaut) here.

So this is "technically" my first blog; However, I'm not too proud of it, and I'll explain why later. If you're a newcomer who came here to watch a tutorial or hear me rant about some new technology, I suggest going to the next blog post.

If you a recruiter/curious person, then welcome!

I'm currently in the market for IT/Developer jobs. If you'd like to learn more of my history, feel free to check out my socials that are in the lower part of the left navigation bar--Including LinkedIn. Also checkout the "[About](/about)" section.

# Personal Projects

This is (an incomplete) list of personal projects I was able to dig up from my Github Repos. I wouldn't say I necessarily feel "proud" of them, because some of these feel incomplete and could have been further progressed on.

Is this an entire representation of all my knowledge and skills? I'd say no. I've read up on a lot of Computer Science, Security, and Networking concepts. I'm also very comfortable with coding for the Web, the command line, and learning new libraries/frameworks. Please see the [About](/about) section for more details on that.

With that being said, let me introduce you to some projects I've worked on, and their significance. _In chronological order_.

## [1. Old Portfolio Site](https://github.com/techienaut/old-portfolio)

- Live Site: [https://github.com/techienaut/old-portfolio](https://github.com/techienaut/old-portfolio)
- Github Repo: [https://github.com/techienaut/old-portfolio](https://github.com/techienaut/old-portfolio)

This was one of the first major projects I did in General Assembly's Coding Bootcamp. It demonstrates knowledges of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap's Nav Bar and a bit of Javascript.

One of the things I do hate about it though is that I somehow managed to delete the Google Spreadsheet that had all my projects. The App.js file in the Assets folder was meant read the spreadsheet to populate a list of "Rocket ship" html components into a Div, and inside the window of the rocket ships was an image that linked to the project.

## [2. My Anime List Clone](https://elated-hermann-2df736.netlify.com/)

- Github Repo: [https://github.com/techienaut/my_anime_list_clone](https://github.com/techienaut/my_anime_list_clone)

I also did this during General Assembly as a major project. This was basically a React project that pulled in a public API for data. There's a site called [myanimelist.net](https://myanimelist.net/) that is like an IMDB for titles of Japanese Anime and Manga (admittedly, I'm partially a weeb ha!). Also there's an API called [jikan.moe](https://jikan.moe/) that pulls data from MyAnimeList and makes if publicly available.

On the Web App, your able to filter by categories and see the top anime and manga. Your also able to click on a title and see info for that anime/manga.

I used a number of libraries including [@brainhubeu/react-carousel](https://brainhubeu.github.io/react-carousel/docs/gettingStarted) for the carousels, [react-bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/), [lodash.throttle](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lodash.throttle), [react-lazyload](https://github.com/twobin/react-lazyload), [react-router-bootstrap](https://github.com/react-bootstrap/react-router-bootstrap), and [react-router-dom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom)

## [3. Micro-Services Blog 01](https://github.com/techienaut/Microsrvcs-Blog-01)

![Micro-Services Blog 01](/assets/img/2021-06-08-blog-0-junk-projects/microsrvcs-blog-01.jpeg)

- Github Repo: [https://github.com/techienaut/Microsrvcs-Blog-01](https://github.com/techienaut/Microsrvcs-Blog-01)
- Udemy Course: [https://www.udemy.com/course/microservices-with-node-js-and-react/](https://www.udemy.com/course/microservices-with-node-js-and-react/)

Unlike the other projects I've mentioned, this one is on the back-burner and on my to-do list to finish. Basically, it's similar to a Reddit clone where people can post and comment on those posts. There maybe some sever-side functions, such as providing a querying API for the client-side or having automatic moderation system on comments before they are posted.

The point of the exercise was to demonstrate spliting backend code into separate Node.js micro-services. There's benefits to this, such as less dependencies between features, and the ability for some feature to function, even when other features are offline/unavailable.

## 4. The Project That Was Lost...

So in General Assembly, we modeled a bookstore, using the MERN stack. On the frontend, it was a list of cards of books, including titles and authors. On the backend, we had to model and provide an API for retrieving book data.

I don't have the code with me, unfortunately. It might have gotten lost because I didn't migrate it from General Assembly's Github Enteprise to my public Github.

# Conclusions/Future Posts

Well, I hope you enjoyed this first blog post. This was sort of a test post--so I'm glad you bared with me. I plan to use this medium to output everything I learn as a developer, and hopefully teach newcomers. I love documentation and helping others. If you have any suggestions, please send me a Tweet or DM on Twitter [@techienaut](https://twitter.com/techienaut). If you're an employer, check out my socials on the left. You can email me or send a connection request with a message on LinkedIn.
